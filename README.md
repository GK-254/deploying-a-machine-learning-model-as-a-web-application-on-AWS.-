# deploying-a-machine-learning-model-as-a-web-application-on-AWS.-
 I recently completed a successful MLOps project which involved deploying a machine learning model as a web application on AWS. The model was trained to classify images of fruits, and the web application would allow users to upload an image and receive a prediction of the fruit in the image. The project required me to utilize various tech skills including Python programming, Docker, AWS EC2, and Flask.

To accomplish this project, I first trained the fruit classification model using TensorFlow and Keras. Once the model was trained, I saved it as a .h5 file and then created a Docker container that would run the Flask web application.

I then pushed the Docker container to an AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and created an EC2 instance to host the web application. I set up the necessary security groups and created an AWS Elastic Load Balancer to distribute traffic to the EC2 instance.

Finally, I tested the web application to ensure that it was working properly. Users could upload an image through the web interface, and the application would classify the fruit in the image and return the result to the user.
